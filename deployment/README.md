# IITGEEPrep Deployment Guide (v17.0)

This guide explains how to deploy the IITGEEPrep application with its new **Granular Component Delivery** architecture to a LAMP stack server (e.g., Hostinger, Bluehost, AWS EC2).

## 1. Source Folder Structure (New Granular Build)

The build process now outputs separate, readable JavaScript files for every major section of the app. This allows for easier debugging and maintainability directly on the server.

```
/ (Project Root)
├── dist/                     # Generated by `npm run build`
│   ├── assets/               # Individual JS/CSS Bundles
│   │   ├── screens/          # Every screen (Dashboard, Test, etc.) as a separate file
│   │   ├── components/       # Major UI components as separate files
│   │   ├── shared-core.js    # Shared libraries and utility logic
│   │   ├── vendor.js         # Third-party dependencies (React, Recharts)
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── index.html            # Entry point
│   └── ...
├── deployment/               # Backend & Config Files
│   ├── api/                  # PHP Backend Scripts
│   ├── sql/                  # Database Schema
│   └── seo/                  # Root Config Files
```

## 2. Server Destination Mapping

Copy files from your **dist** folder to the server's **public_html** directory.

| Component | Source Folder (Local) | Destination Folder (Server `public_html`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main HTML** | `dist/index.html` | `public_html/index.html` |
| **JS & Assets** | `dist/assets/*` | `public_html/assets/` |
| **Backend API** | `deployment/api/*` | `public_html/api/` |
| **Database** | `deployment/sql/*.sql` | *Import via phpMyAdmin* |
| **Root Config** | `deployment/seo/*` | `public_html/` (includes .htaccess) |

## 3. maintainability Features

- **Granular Chunks**: If you only need to modify the logic for the "Test Center", you can find `screens/TestScreen.js` in your assets folder.
- **Human Readable**: Files are not minified (v17.0+). You can read and edit them using any code editor.
- **Indentation**: All generated bundles follow standard indentation for clear debugging.

## 4. Troubleshooting the Granular Build

If a specific screen fails to load:
1. Check the Browser Console. It will indicate if a specific chunk (e.g., `assets/screens/AnalyticsScreen.js`) is missing.
2. Ensure you uploaded the entire `assets/` folder, including subdirectories.
3. Verify that your `.htaccess` file is in the root directory to handle SPA routing correctly.
